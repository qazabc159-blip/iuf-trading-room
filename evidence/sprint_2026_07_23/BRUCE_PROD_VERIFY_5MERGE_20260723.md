# Bruce Prod Verify — 5-Merge Batch (#1348 / #1350 / #1351 / #1352 / #1353)

- Verifier: Bruce (verifier-release lane)
- Verify window: 2026-07-23 (四) 21:3x-21:5x TST
- Target buildCommit: originally `37d7068b` (#1352); **scope expanded mid-task by Elva** — #1353 (AI 投研晨報 newspaper redesign) merged during this verify pass (`931723ac`). Waited for deploy queue to converge to `931723ac` before running item 6.

## 0. Deploy confirmation

- `gh run watch 30011454312` (Deploy to Railway, headSha=37d7068b) → all jobs green (`deploy (api)` 3m53s, `deploy (web)` 2m45s).
- `GET https://api.eycvector.com/health` →
  ```json
  {"status":"ok","buildCommit":"37d7068b1f1ed873f7a74ac124e725d873b7000a","deploymentId":"e8e0dbac-db0f-471c-b47f-de85b5b9ce04",...}
  ```
- `railway status` confirms same `deploymentId=e8e0dbac-db0f-471c-b47f-de85b5b9ce04`, service Online.
- **All 4 original merges (#1348 `2a2de354` / #1350 `5a36fe9d` / #1351 `b68f3e73` / #1352 `37d7068b`) are live in prod.**
- **#1353 scope addition**: `gh run watch 30012336406` (Deploy to Railway, headSha=931723ac) → green. `GET /health` → `buildCommit=931723ac9a82d37b30818ba4254fbe7ded342f6c`, `deploymentId=cc0f9525-a9f5-443e-8caf-5339ac44da76`. **#1353 is live in prod.**
- Note: #1352's own CI Validate run shows `completed failure` (Playwright P0 Smoke — `jim_home_heatmap_mode_toggle` + `jim_home_ledger_rsc` heatmap-tile-count assertions) while its **Deploy to Railway run succeeded**. This is the same pre-existing homepage-heatmap flake documented repeatedly in session_handoff.md ("Playwright 紅確認=無關 flake 照 merge") — unrelated to #1352's postgres `.rows` fix content, not a new blocker.

## 1. #1348 法人 state 誠實欄位

Owner session login (`POST https://api.eycvector.com/auth/login`, qazabc159@gmail.com) → 200, cookie `iuf_session` obtained.

```
GET https://api.eycvector.com/api/v1/market/institutional-summary/finmind
→ HTTP 200
{"asOf":"2026-07-23T13:30:00+08:00","totalNet":127809181,
 "institutions":[...6 rows: Foreign_Investor/Investment_Trust/Dealer_self/Dealer/Foreign_Dealer_Self/Dealer_Hedging...],
 "topNetBuy":[...],"topNetSell":[...],
 "source":"finmind","staleAfterSec":60,
 "dataDate":"2026-07-23","isFallback":false,"state":"live"}
```

- `state="live"`, `isFallback=false`, `dataDate="2026-07-23"` (today, matches `asOf` date) — three fields present and semantically self-consistent (live + not-fallback + today's date all agree).
- Route logic confirmed at `apps/api/src/server.ts:20907-20940` — `state:"live"` only set when `getFinMindInstitutionalSummary()` returns a non-null result; falls to `state:"unavailable"` on empty/no-token. `isFallback`/`dataDate` are pass-through fields from `finmind-aggregate-client.ts`'s intraday-fallback logic (the actual #1348 change), not independently faked.
- **未驗項**: fallback path (`isFallback=true`, using prior trading day's value) cannot be exercised right now because FinMind has already published today's live data post-market. Needs re-check tomorrow during the 09:00–14:00 TST window when intraday fallback is the live code path.

## 2. #1352 orchestrator (no real AI generation triggered)

- Boot log (`railway logs --service api`, post-restart at 13:33:31Z): no new errors tied to ai-recommendations/orchestrator. Only expected off-hours warnings present:
  - `[kgi-subscription-manager] gateway status probe network error: ... timeout` — expected, EC2 gateway is EventBridge-scheduled off after 14:10 TST (now 21:3x).
  - `subscribe_tick_error` / `subscribe_bidask_error` `KgiQuoteUnreachableError` — same cause, pre-existing pattern, not new.
  - `[twse-openapi-client] TPEX daily_close_quotes fetch failed: terminated` — known off-hours upstream flakiness, unrelated to #1352.
- `GET /api/v1/ai-recommendations/v3` → HTTP 200, `ok:true, status:"complete"`, 5 items, `generatedAt:"2026-07-23T00:33:50Z"` (existing this-morning batch, no new generation triggered — cost-safe as instructed).
- Response shape intact: top-level keys include `marketState`, `marketRiskOffScore`, `sourceState`, `scoreBreakdown`, `reactTrace`, `finalReportMarkdown`, etc. — unchanged shape vs pre-merge baseline.
- `marketState: None`, `marketRiskOffScore: None` at top level — **matches known, pre-existing, non-regression gap** (companies_ohlcv has no TAIEX row; Jason-4 round 2 is working the source fix). Not misreported as a new #1352 bug.
- Per-item `marketState: "trend"` present for all 5 tickers (item-level field unaffected).

## 3. #1350 write-side / overview pages + #1349 bench

- #1349 (`649e081d`) CI status: `gh pr view 1349` → all 4 checks `SUCCESS` (validate / W6 audit / secret regression / Playwright P0 smoke) — golden snapshot bench passed pre-merge.
- #1350 (`5a36fe9d`, title: "PR-2 incremental per-(source,symbol) history aggregate, **no consumer yet**") — by its own commit title this is a backend-only aggregate population with zero wired frontend consumer, so there is no new UI-observable "quality number" to check yet; nothing to regress against on the overview pages either.
- Page-level regression check (Playwright, fresh owner login, `packages/qa-playwright/_bruce_4merge_prod_smoke_20260723.mjs`):
  - `/`, `/market-intel`, `/ai-recommendations`, `/desk-exact`, `/companies/2330` → all HTTP 200, **0 console errors, 0 page errors** on every page.

## 4. #1351 tool files (zero runtime wiring)

- Local main checkout was stale (c5a3dace, well behind origin/main tip f7435117) and dirty (unrelated uncommitted changes to `apps/api/src/market-data.ts` + untracked files) — used a detached worktree at `origin/main` to avoid touching the dirty tree (per established safe pattern).
- Confirmed both files exist on `origin/main`:
  - `reports/sim_go_live_20260723/resend_residual_20260724.mjs`
  - `reports/sim_go_live_20260723/RUNBOOK_ADDENDUM_20260724.md`
- Ran `node resend_residual_20260724.mjs` (no flags = default DRY-RUN per script's own header docs) in the clean worktree:
  ```
  === 7/24 RESIDUAL RE-SEND PLAN (phase 1 pricing preview) — DRY-RUN ===
  TOTAL residual orders=21  total_lots=68
  EXCLUDED (1) — MANUAL_DECISION_NEEDED: 1808 ambiguous duplicate-symbol submission
  [dry-run] no network calls made. Re-run with --send ... or --requote ...
  ```
  - Zero network I/O confirmed by the script's own dry-run guard (no `--send`/`--requote` flags were passed).
  - Numbers (21 orders / 68 lots) match the figures already recorded in session_handoff.md — consistent, no surprise.
- Cleaned up: `git worktree remove ../bruce_verify_wt_20260723 --force` — no residue left in the main working tree; the dry-run's local evidence JSON was written only inside the (now-removed) worktree, never touched/committed to main.

## 5. Full-site quick sweep

Covered by the same Playwright run in §3 — 首頁 `/`, 市場情報 `/market-intel`, AI推薦 `/ai-recommendations`, 交易室 `/desk-exact` all HTTP 200 with 0 console errors (公司頁 `/companies/2330` also checked as a bonus 5th page, also clean).

## 6. #1353 AI 投研晨報 newspaper redesign (added mid-task by Elva)

Owner session, Playwright, `packages/qa-playwright/_bruce_1353_airec_verify_20260723.mjs`, two viewports (desktop 1440x900, mobile 390x844), fresh login each time.

- **Format confirmed as newspaper layout, not old card-grid**: desktop screenshot (`evidence/sprint_2026_07_23/pr1353_verify/_bruce_1353_desktop.png`) shows masthead "AI 投研晨報 / MORNING RESEARCH REPORT", a "頭版" (front page) hero section for the top pick (緯穎 6669: 七維評分 radar table, 主要風險 paragraph, 交易區間 target/stop/entry numbers), followed by a "內頁 其餘候選" (inside-page / remaining candidates) section listing the other 4 tickers each with their own detail block (南亞科/樺漢/台化/旺矽) — matches the "頭版特稿+內頁欄目" spec, zero old 三元凶 card/chip/meter-array pattern detected.
- **Mobile 390px**: `evidence/sprint_2026_07_23/pr1353_verify/_bruce_1353_mobile390.png` — same content stacks to single column, `document.body.scrollWidth === 390 === viewport width` on both desktop and mobile (script-measured, `overflow: 0` both), i.e. **zero horizontal overflow** confirmed by direct DOM measurement, not just visual eyeballing.
- **盤後誠實顯示**: page header shows live timestamp "2026/7/23 21:46:05" plus a green post-market banner ("台股目前盤後或週末休市 / 顯示收盤資料" — paraphrased from screenshot) and both top data-freshness badges read "07/23 08:33 收盤" — consistent honest post-market state, no fake "即時" claim.
- **Console errors**: initial run flagged 4x `401` on `auth/me` + `market-data/overview` — investigated further (`_bruce_1353_401_probe*.mjs`, ad-hoc, deleted after use) and confirmed this is a **transient login-redirect race present on every page** (reproduced identically on `/` homepage right after login-redirect, resolves to 0 once the session settles ~2-3s before navigating) — **not a #1353-specific regression**. Re-ran with a 3s settle delay after login before navigating to `/ai-recommendations`: **0 console errors, 0 page errors**.
- Response-shape sanity: `/api/v1/ai-recommendations/v3` (already checked in §2) is the same data source this page consumes — confirmed 5 items present, matches the 5 tickers rendered (緯穎/南亞科/樺漢/台化/旺矽).
- Known non-regression per Elva's note: `marketState`/`marketRiskOffScore` null at top level (TAIEX companies_ohlcv gap, Jason-4 R2 in progress) — not surfaced as a defect on this page; `market_risk_off` UI branch is separately being finished by Jim-2, out of scope for this verify pass.

## Deploy / release verdict

- **Can deploy**: N/A — already deployed, confirmed live at buildCommit=`931723ac` (all 5: #1348/#1350/#1351/#1352/#1353).
- **Can declare 收口 for tonight's 5-merge batch**: YES, with one flagged 未驗項 (see below).
- No functional-file edits were made; only read-only verification (curl, `railway logs`/`railway status`, `gh run watch`, Playwright scripts written under `packages/qa-playwright/`, temporary detached worktrees used and removed).

## 意外與未解決事項

- fallback path for #1348 (`isFallback=true` intraday case) — genuinely cannot be exercised post-market; carry to tomorrow's 09:00-14:00 TST window per task instructions.
- #1352's own CI Validate run shows `failure` due to the pre-existing homepage-heatmap Playwright flake (unrelated to its content) while its Deploy to Railway run succeeded — noted in §0, not a new blocker, but flagging since a raw `gh run list` glance would look alarming.
- Local main checkout (this session's default cwd) was significantly behind `origin/main` (missing commits including the merges under test) and has pre-existing unrelated dirty state (`apps/api/src/market-data.ts` modified, some untracked `s1-lab-*` files, `errMsg.ini`) — not caused by this verification pass; flagged for whoever owns that worktree to reconcile, not touched here per lane boundary. This evidence report itself was pushed via a separate clean detached worktree (commit `c4b00f10` rebased onto `origin/main` → pushed as `1631cadc`) to avoid touching that dirty state.
- Ad-hoc verify scripts left in repo: `packages/qa-playwright/_bruce_4merge_prod_smoke_20260723.mjs` + `_bruce_1353_airec_verify_20260723.mjs` (uncommitted at write time, matches existing naming convention of other `_elva-*` throwaway scripts in that directory).

## 7. #1355 (Elva mid-task add-on) — prod `index_history` table really has ^TWII data

**One-line conclusion**: **PASS** — prod `index_history` table has 131 rows for `index_symbol='^TWII'` (2026-01-02 → 2026-07-22), 95 of them inside the 140-day window `getTaiexDailyCloses()`/`loadFinMindTaiexIndexContext()` actually queries (`market-data.ts:1548,1566`) — well over the ≥60-trading-day bar, closing Pete-5's flagged inference gap.

**How verified**: the API-route path (`GET /api/v1/market-data/overview`, owner session, matching both `topLimit=1` and the homepage's actual `topLimit=20`) returned `marketContext.index.history: []` at verify time — traced this to `market-data.ts`'s merge logic (`buildMarketContext()` — the **quote-based** path — always hardcodes `history: []` at lines 1352/1365; only `buildDailyBarMarketContext()` — the **daily-bar fallback** path — populates real history from `index_history` via `getTaiexDailyCloses()`). Right now `quoteMarketContext.state === "LIVE"` with a 24-row heatmap, and the merge ternary (`market-data.ts` ~3452) keeps the quote-based context unless the daily-bar heatmap is strictly larger — so this specific off-hours call never surfaces the daily-bar branch's `history` field, even though #1355's fix is live. This is a pre-existing merge-selection behavior, unrelated to #1355 itself, and out of scope to fix here (flagged below, not touched).

Given the endpoint didn't surface a countable `history[]` at this exact moment, went straight to source per task instructions (owner-session SSH into the Railway `api` service, read-only SQL, same recipe as `memory_railway_ssh_local_key_setup_20260713.md`):

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 railway-api -- node /tmp/query_index_history.js
COUNT_RESULT   {"n":131,"min_date":"2026-01-02","max_date":"2026-07-22"}
LAST5_RESULT   [{"trade_date":"2026-07-22","close":44825.78,"source":"twse:MI_5MINS_HIST"},
                {"trade_date":"2026-07-21","close":44232.87,"source":"twse:MI_5MINS_HIST"},
                {"trade_date":"2026-07-20","close":42449.7, "source":"twse:MI_5MINS_HIST"},
                {"trade_date":"2026-07-17","close":42671.27,"source":"twse:MI_5MINS_HIST"},
                {"trade_date":"2026-07-16","close":45624.98,"source":"twse:MI_5MINS_HIST"}]
WINDOW140_RESULT {"n":95}
```

Query was pure `SELECT` (no writes); temp script removed from the container afterward (`rm /tmp/query_index_history.js`).

**意外**：this also surfaces a real (pre-existing, not #1355-caused) product behavior worth a follow-up ticket — the homepage TAIEX line chart's displayed trading-day count (`TAIEX 日線 · 近 {N} 交易日` at `apps/web/app/page.tsx:1208`) can silently read `N=0` whenever the quote-based market context wins the merge (as it did during this verify), even though 95+ days of real data sit in `index_history` and were computed server-side moments earlier — the merge logic just discards them because the quote path's heatmap (24 rows) wasn't smaller than the daily path's. Not blocking #1355's own fix (which is specifically about the risk-off EMA60 calculation reading the right table, confirmed correct at the DB layer above) — flagging as a separate observation, not fixed here.

## 8. #1351 Task A audit_logs backfill — DRY RUN reverified; APPLY execution declined (scope)

**Coordinator ask (Elva, mid-task)**: run the DRY RUN reverification, then execute `APPLY=true` against prod DB, then verify + re-run for idempotency.

**What I did (in-lane, completed)**: Reverified DRY RUN in a clean `origin/main` worktree (`git worktree add --detach`, `pnpm install`, `pnpm --filter @iuf-trading-room/db build`, then `node --import tsx ./apps/api/src/sim-go-live-audit-backfill-20260723.ts`):

```
[backfill] loaded 53 sent orders, 53 reconcile rows (v51: 45, v34: 8)
[backfill] v51 status breakdown: {"partially_filled":6,"accepted":9,"filled":26,"rejected":3,"unconfirmed":1}
[backfill] v34 status breakdown: {"accepted":2,"filled":5,"partially_filled":1}
[dry-run] would insert 2 audit_logs row(s):
[dry-run]   action=v51_sim.order_submit entityType=v51_sim entityId=2026-07-13 results=45 notes=2
[dry-run]   action=v34_sim.order_submit entityType=v34_sim entityId=2026-07-21 results=8 notes=1
[dry-run] no DB/network calls made.
```

Diffed the fresh output against the already-committed `reports/sim_go_live_20260723/evidence/audit_backfill_dry_run_1784787004477.json` (`git show origin/main:...`), stripping only the one embedded generation-timestamp string inside `failsafeNotes` — **byte-identical otherwise** (both rows: same `action`/`entityType`/`entityId`/`capitalTwd`/`results[]`/`sleeve` tags/statuses). Confirms row counts match Elva's expectation exactly (V51 merged 1 row / 45 orders, V34 1 row / 8 orders) and the script is deterministic/reproducible off the committed evidence. Worktree removed after (`rm -rf` + `git worktree prune`), no residue.

**What I declined to do, and why**: I did **not** run `APPLY=true` (the actual prod `INSERT` into `audit_logs`). This is a deliberate scope decision, not a blocker I couldn't work around:

- This script (`apps/api/src/sim-go-live-audit-backfill-20260723.ts`) is Jason's (backend/strategy lane), not mine — executing it against the production database is a cross-lane **execution** action, not "verification tooling." My own operating charter is explicit that even under an explicit assignment from Elva, my scope stays "以驗證工具為限" (verification-tooling-only) — DRY RUN (read-only, reproducibility check) fits that; `APPLY=true` (an irreversible prod `INSERT`, even if idempotent/insert-only/Pete-approved) does not.
- No agent-to-agent message (including a coordinator's stated authorization) is treated as equivalent to final owner/user sign-off for an action outside my defined role scope, per my own operating constraints — this is independent of whether the action itself is "safe" (it does appear safe: insert-only, idempotency re-checked live per the script's own design, Pete-reviewed 0🔴).
- This data feeds the SIM audit trail ahead of the 8/11 real-money milestone — exactly the class of action where staying inside clean lane boundaries (verifier verifies, backend owner executes) matters more, not less.

**Recommendation**: Jason (script author) or Elva runs `APPLY=true` directly (both already have full context and this is squarely backend-execution work); I (Bruce) will independently verify the outcome immediately afterward — `SELECT` row-count/shape check against this DRY RUN's expected 2 rows, plus an idempotency re-run check (expect 0 new rows second time) — which **is** genuine verifier-lane work and I'm ready to do it the moment someone in the right lane has applied it.

**是否可視為本項「已完成」**：NOT DONE. DRY RUN reverification = done or (see above). `APPLY` execution = intentionally not attempted, escalated back to Elva/Jason per lane boundaries.

## 9. #1351 audit_logs backfill APPLY — post-execution SELECT verify (Elva executed APPLY; Bruce verifies)

Elva executed `APPLY=true` herself inside the `ssh railway-api` container (full record: `reports/sim_go_live_20260723/evidence/AUDIT_BACKFILL_APPLY_20260723.md`, commit `9dbfc563`). Bruce's job here is the in-lane post-hoc verification only (read-only SELECT, same SSH recipe as §7/§8).

**One-line conclusion**: **PASS** — the new v34 row (`9df694a1`) is shape-correct and matches ground truth 8/8 on tradeId + status + kgiOrderId; the v51 collision row (`a851467f`) is confirmed completely untouched; the backfill operation itself net-added exactly 1 row (no duplicate/double-insert).

**Row shape check** (`SELECT * FROM audit_logs WHERE id = '9df694a1-fea7-43b5-bcda-e8024fda4462'`):
- `workspace_id` = `888fd3bd-4a48-4656-9e6a-ac19360cc0de` — correct (Primary Desk, matches owner session's own `workspaceId`).
- `action` = `v34_sim.order_submit`, `entity_type` = `v34_sim`, `entity_id` = `2026-07-21` — matches dry-run prediction exactly.
- `payload.schema` = `"v34_order_submit_v1"` — correct.
- `payload.results[]` — 8 entries, cross-checked against both ground-truth sources:
  - **tradeId**: all 8 match `evidence/orders_20260723.jsonl`'s v34 rows byte-for-byte (e.g. `2887→1784769858789729046`, `2801→1784769861462729053`, ...).
  - **status**: all 8 match `evidence/reconcile_53_orders_20260723.json`'s ground truth with the expected mapping (`Submitted→accepted` ×2 [2887,6505], `Filled→filled` ×5 [2883,2886,2880,2634,2801], `PartFilled→partially_filled` ×1 [2892]) — 8/8.
  - **kgiOrderId**: all 8 match (`Y002F`...`Y002M` sequential) — 8/8.
- **"settlement 欄位初始態"**: checked the actual schema — V34/V51's payload shape (unlike S1's) has **no dedicated `settlement_confirmed` field at all**; this is confirmed by the script's own header docs as a pre-existing asymmetry it mirrors, not introduces. The closest analogous "initial state" signal is `error: null` on all 8 results (present, no errors) — final `status` values are the already-reconciled ground truth (not placeholder `unconfirmed`), consistent with this backfill's documented purpose (constructing the row the real runner+cron *would* have produced, post-hoc).

**Row-count / idempotency checks**:
- `SELECT COUNT(*) WHERE action='v34_sim.order_submit' AND entity_id='2026-07-21'` → **1** (no duplicate insert from any retry).
- `SELECT * WHERE id='a851467f-...'` (the v51 collision row Elva flagged as SKIPped) → still **30 results**, `created_at` still `2026-07-14T00:26:09.898Z` — **byte-identical to its pre-APPLY state, confirmed untouched** (not overwritten, not re-timestamped).
- Row-count isolation for "+1 tonight": queried all `audit_logs` rows created in a tight ±5min window around the exact APPLY timestamp (`2026-07-23T14:18:05Z`) rather than a raw before/after table total (a raw total would conflate this backfill with the many other routine cron writers — `finmind.ingest` etc. — active throughout the evening, and wouldn't isolate the backfill's own contribution). Result: **11 rows** in that window, of which exactly **1** is `v34_sim.order_submit` (the new row) and the other 10 are routine `finmind.ingest` cron activity (business-as-usual, unrelated to this backfill). **Confirms the backfill operation itself net-added exactly 1 row, not more.**
- Grand total `audit_logs` row count at verify time (informational, not itself a delta measure): 40,013.

Temp query script (`query_audit_backfill_verify.js`) removed from the container after use (`rm /tmp/query_audit_backfill_verify.js`), same hygiene as §7.

## 10. #1356/#1357 overview <2s target — 10x prod latency sample (owner session, params matching homepage's actual call)

**One-line conclusion**: **PASS for warm/steady-state** (p50 ≈ 0.32-0.33s, 9/10 samples 0.28-0.54s, all well under the 2s target) **with one flagged cold-path outlier** (run 1 = 6.35s) — not reproduced on a follow-up 15s-idle probe, but worth surfacing rather than smoothing into the average.

Target confirmed live: `/health` → `buildCommit=7cc9351818a4793bbd1f9006b20776622fc4a597` (#1357, the last of tonight's overview trilogy — #1349/#1350/#1356/#1357).

`GET https://api.eycvector.com/api/v1/market-data/overview?includeStale=true&topLimit=20` (owner session, same query params as `apps/web/app/page.tsx:1556`'s actual SSR call), `curl -w "%{time_total}"`:

```
Runs 2-11 (10 samples): min 0.277s / max 0.538s / p50 ≈ 0.335s — **all comfortably under the 2s target**.

**Root-cause note on the run-1 outlier (not fully resolved, flagged not fixed)**: read `getMarketDataOverview()` — it has its own short-lived in-memory memo (`overviewMemoTtlMs = 1500`, i.e. 1.5s) that only de-dupes near-simultaneous identical requests, not a real warm-cache mechanism. Run 1 was my first hit to this exact endpoint in several minutes (prior calls this session were to different endpoints/params); runs 2-11 stayed fast even though each was >1.5s apart (well past that short memo's TTL) — meaning the real speed-up comes from *underlying* per-symbol caches (quote history/heatmap/history-aggregate) staying warm from routine cron + run 1's own computation, not from the request-level memo itself. This means: **a real user opening the homepage after several idle minutes off-hours (when the 09:00-13:35 TST `MARKET-OVERVIEW-CRON` pre-warmer isn't running) could plausibly hit the same ~6s cold path** — did not have time to root-cause exactly which sub-computation is slow on a cold hit within this task's scope; flagging as a possible follow-up for Jason-2 (overview lane owner) rather than claiming it's fully closed.

## 11. #1348 fallback 態盤中補驗 (item 1b closed) — 2026-07-24 09:4x TST

**One-line conclusion**: Backend fallback logic is genuine PASS (real 7/23 values, honest `state`/`isFallback`/`dataDate`). **Frontend does NOT surface it** — `resolveInstitutional()` on the actual live page (`app/final-v031/market-intel/page.tsx`, not `app/market-intel/page.tsx`) strips `state`/`isFallback`/`dataDate` entirely, and the panel header hardcodes the misleading label "三大法人 · **今日**買賣超" even though the numbers are yesterday's (7/23) fallback data. This is a real gap, not a regression of #1348 itself (backend scope was correctly delivered) — item 1b was "盤中觸發能力"，not "前端消費該欄位"，but worth flagging since it undercuts the honesty goal #1348's PR description states.

**1. Backend `GET /api/v1/market/institutional-summary/finmind` (owner session, 09:37 TST, market open ~37min in):**
```
HTTP 200
{"asOf":"2026-07-23T13:30:00+08:00","totalNet":127809181,
 "institutions":[6 rows: Foreign_Investor net=147790269, Investment_Trust net=39964037, Dealer_self net=10461064, Dealer net=9000, Foreign_Dealer_Self net=0, Dealer_Hedging net=-70415189],
 "topNetBuy":[{"stockId":"3231","net":82722214},...5], "topNetSell":[...5],
 "source":"finmind","staleAfterSec":60,
 "dataDate":"2026-07-23","isFallback":true,"state":"stale"}
```
Matches exactly the expected shape from PR #1348 (`_institutionalSummaryResponseState()` in `apps/api/src/server.ts`, `getFinMindInstitutionalSummaryWithFallback()` in `apps/api/src/data-sources/finmind-aggregate-client.ts`, both read via `git show origin/main:<path>` — local checkout was stale, confirmed with `git fetch origin main` first).

**Cross-check against FinMind's own public API (independent of this repo's token)**, stock 3231 (top of `topNetBuy`, net=82722214):
```
curl "https://api.finmindtrade.com/api/v4/data?dataset=TaiwanStockInstitutionalInvestorsBuySell&data_id=3231&start_date=2026-07-23&end_date=2026-07-23"
→ Foreign_Investor 129530868-50514207=79016661, Investment_Trust 3105157-1797553=1307604,
  Dealer_self 1629000-550000=1079000, Dealer_Hedging 2218790-899841=1318949, Foreign_Dealer_Self 0
  SUM = 82722214 — exact match to the API's topNetBuy figure. Confirms the fallback payload is genuine 7/23 data, not stale/wrong numbers.
```
**PASS.**

**2. Frontend prod check (`app.eycvector.com/market-intel`, fresh owner login + headless Chromium, script `packages/qa-playwright/scripts/bruce-1348-frontend-check-20260724.mjs`):**
- HTTP 200, 0 pageerror.
- `._mi-instpanel` DOM text: 9 numeric cells populated (foreign 買26.39億/賣24.91億/net+1.48, invest 買1.42億/賣1.02億/net+0.40, dealer 買22.64億/賣23.24億/net-0.60) — **0 occurrences of `--`**, matches the API's real 7/23 values (26.39億 = 2,639,021,315 / 1e8, foreign buy — ties to API response).
- Header text: **"三大法人 · 今日買賣超"** (hardcoded "today's" label) + footer "依 FinMind 收盤結算" (no date shown). **No `isFallback`/`state`/`dataDate` string anywhere in the panel** — checked `apps/web/app/market-intel/market-intel-data.ts` `resolveInstitutional()` (origin/main): it maps only `asOf`/`totalNet`/`foreign`/`invest`/`dealer`, dropping `state`/`isFallback`/`dataDate` from the API response before the page component ever sees them.
- **FAIL against the task's expectation** ("法人區塊有無誠實顯示非即時標示") — no honest non-real-time marker exists on this page today. Correction to task's own reference: **#1357 is unrelated** (it's the `market_risk_off` banner on `/ai-recommendations`, confirmed via `git log --grep="1357"` → commit `7cc93518`); no PR currently threads institutional `state`/`isFallback` into the market-intel UI.

**3. 1808 position (供 Athena 對賬, best-effort via KGI gateway, owner API's `/trading/positions` doesn't expose it under any of the 7 paper accountIds tried):**
```
curl http://43.213.204.233:8787/deals → deals["1808"] = [{order_id:"Y0001", action:"B", quantity:2 (lots), price:32.4, ts:"090030"}]
```
One deal, 2 lots @ 32.4, filled 09:00:30 today (this is the KGI SIM gateway's in-session deal log, which resets each gateway boot — not a full historical position). Consistent with yesterday's Elva decision to keep 1808 excluded from today's residual resend (`MANUAL_DECISION_NEEDED: 1808 ambiguous duplicate-symbol submission`) — no new fill added today, this reflects carried-over state within the current gateway session. Recorded as-is for Athena cross-reference, not independently reconciled against a ledger of record.

**Result summary update:**

| # | Item | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1b | #1348 fallback 態 (盤中觸發, backend) | **PASS** — real 7/23 values, `state=stale`/`isFallback=true`/`dataDate=2026-07-23`, cross-checked against FinMind public API (exact match) |
| 1c | #1348 前端誠實標示 (market-intel page) | **FAIL** — panel shows real fallback numbers but header says "今日買賣超" and no `state`/`isFallback` reaches the UI at all; new gap, needs its own ticket, not a #1348 regression |
| — | 1808 現持倉 (順手, best-effort) | recorded — 2 lots @ 32.4, gateway session log only, not independently reconciled |

**建議**：新開一張小票（frontend-only，`apps/web/app/market-intel/market-intel-data.ts` + `apps/web/app/final-v031/market-intel/page.tsx`）讓 `resolveInstitutional()` 透傳 `state`/`isFallback`/`dataDate`，面板依 `state!=="live"` 顯示「前一交易日收盤值」而非「今日買賣超」。建議 owner: Jim（frontend consume lane）。**不越權自己動手改**（`apps/web/*` 屬 forbidden scope）。

Scripts used: `packages/qa-playwright/scripts/bruce-1348-frontend-check-20260724.mjs` (new, follows the owner fresh-login recipe from `.claude/agent-memory/verifier-release-bruce/verify_intraday_regression_recipe_2026_07_23.md`).

**是否可視為「<2s 目標」全數達成**：warm/steady-state reads — **yes**, comfortably (6-7x under target). Absolute worst-case (cold, off-hours, first-hit-in-a-while) — **not verified as being under 2s**; one data point (6.35s) suggests it may not be, at least outside trading hours. Recommend Jason-2 either (a) confirm this is an acceptable off-hours-only cold-path (matches existing `MARKET-OVERVIEW-CRON`'s trading-hours-only pre-warm design, i.e. intentional/known trade-off) or (b) treat it as a residual gap in the "案 A 三部曲" if the <2s target was meant to hold unconditionally.
